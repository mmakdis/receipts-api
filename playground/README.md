# Playground

My research area where I test new methods/approaches before I implement them into the application.

After the features have been implemented in the application, the test approaches are either removed or moved to `archive`.

Run `jupyter lab` to start playing around.

Some scripts are ran seperately, the `venv` is in the parent directory:

`source venv/bin/activate`
